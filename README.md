# Frugality - WIP

Current iteration of the groceries price calculator.
WIP, host over the internet at your own risk.

I will begin migrating this to FastAPI & PostgresSQL which will mean rewrites.

Basic project idea/vision:
- Grocery bag price calulcator
- Scope of the project is limited to the larger grocery store chains situated in Finland
- Able to compare competitors store prices for entire grocery lists / individual recipes / individual items
- Able to utilize google maps api to search nearby stores by utilizing a given street address (user defined radius)
- Able to factor in transit cost into final calculation
- Able to factor in potential delivery cost into final calculation
