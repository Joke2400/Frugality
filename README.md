# Frugality

A webapp to help you find the cheapest groceries near you.
This is a long-term project that I like to work on in my free time.

**NOTE:** *Currently being rewritten with FastAPI / Postgres / Vue.js, may be a bit funky at times. Work has thus far focused on rewriting the backend code.*

## What is this?
### The problem:
- Groceries price comparison tools exist in Finland, but most are built by the grocery store chains themselves.
- The incentives for transparency do not necessarily always align with corporate profit incentives.
- Not that simple to access, some require even you to be a part of a loyalty-programme.

### Project vision:
- A simple-to-use, unbiased groceries price comparison app, built for use within Finland.
- Current project scope is limited to grocery stores in Finland.
    - S-Ryhm√§/Kesko-stores will be implemented first.
- Free-to-use, will be made available through a website and (maybe) a mobile app.

### Planned features
- Compare several stores & products simultaneously.
- Location-based searching (ex. 'compare stores near you') using gmaps API.
- Factor in other costs (ex. delivery or transit costs).
- Price history statistics:
    - Results get cached server-side to maintain a historical record.
    - Keeps track of price development (ex. inflation/greedflation, drops in price/sales).
    - Keeps track of product sizes (ex. to monitor shrinkflation).
    - Will periodically update records of popular products/stores.

## Set up for development
**NOTE:** *The project is a WIP - it's recommended to only host it locally at the moment.*

### Prerequisites:
- The project requires Python 3.12 due to the use of newer syntax.
- This project assumes the use of VSCode:
    - Extensions: Python & Devcontainers
- Docker for containerization:
    - Installing only the Docker Engine is recommended on Linux, as Docker Desktop seems to cause file-permission to be set to 'root' inside the container which leads to permission errors on runtime after building the backend image. A workaround is to of course manually change the permissions after building.

## Steps:

1. **Run the setup.sh install script (Linux only)**
    - setup.sh creates a `.env` file with default environment variables for the apps, remember change the password environment variable.
    - **NOTE:** *Environment variables are inherently unsafe for credentials, hence the disclaimer above about hosting over the internet. This method is temporary & will be remedied at a later point.*
    - setup.sh will also install the `virtualenv` package if it's not already installed & create a new Python virtual environment at the project root.
    - This allows the backend to be run from outside a container *(for debugging purposes)*, although the database url in /backend/app/process.py currently needs to be manually changed for the backend to be able to connect to the database.

2. **Or if you want to do this manually (Or you're running Windows)**

    - Ensure you have `virtualenv` installed. (Install with: `pip install virtualenv`).
    - Open the terminal & ensure you're in the project root directory.
    - Create a Python virtual environment by running the command below:
        - `virtualenv name_for_your_env --python='path_to_your_python_3.12.exe'`
    - Next up, activate the virtual environment by running the following:
        - Windows - `./name_for_your_env/Scripts/activate`
        - Linux - `source /name_for_your_env/Scripts/activate`
    - Then install the required dependencies with pip:
        - `pip install -r ./backend/requirements.txt`
    
    
3. **Run the application**
    

    **Run the backend inside the container**
    - Press ctrl+shift+p inside of VSCode and select the *'Devcontainers: Rebuild and reopen in container'* option.
    - Devcontainers will then build & run the docker services defined in the docker compose file.
    - You're done! The containers are now running in Docker!


    **OR**


    **Run the backend locally**
    - The postgres database used can be an external one, or the one defined by docker-compose (remember to build the project once before running the backend locally) When running the backend locally, the database url in /backend/app/process.py currently needs to be manually changed for the backend to be able to connect to the database.
    - Ensure you're using the virtualenv:
        - Windows - `./name_for_your_env/Scripts/activate`
        - Linux - `source /name_for_your_env/Scripts/activate`
    - Then debug the backend via VSCode using the `Python: FastAPI` launch option defined in `launch.json`
    - Or run the python file `backend/main.py` from WHEN WITHIN the project root directory /Frugality/
