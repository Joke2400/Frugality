# Frugality v 0.1 - WIP

Current iteration of the groceries price calculator.

Changes: Data is collected directly via an API. (Websites without one will still use the webscraper for this task)
The webscraper is currently not functional, as I was in the middle of an overhaul when the target website changed domains and it's structure :(
This has been left in though, as scraping other competitor websites may still require it in the future.

"active" branch shows current progress
